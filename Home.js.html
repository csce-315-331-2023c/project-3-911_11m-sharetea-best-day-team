            Mr. Cheng Kai-Lung, the founder of Sharetea, was working in the film
            and TV industry as a director in 1992. Although being a director
            seems like one of the most glamorous jobs in the world, he was not
            satisfied yet. He quit his job and started his own tea street vendor
            business. At first, he encountered many hardships, but instead of
            giving up, he deeply believed “when you have strong faith, big
            thing happens”. &lt;br>&lt;/br>
            &lt;br>&lt;/br>
            After all the hard work he put in, Sharetea was adored by the
            crowd, and that was how the first Sharetea store got started.
          &lt;/p>
        &lt;/div>
